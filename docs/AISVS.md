## What is AISVS?

The **Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Standard (AISVS)** is a community-driven catalogue of testable security requirements for AI-enabled systems. It gives developers, architects, security engineers, and auditors a structured framework to design, build, test, and verify the security of AI applications throughout their lifecycle, from data collection and model training to deployment, monitoring, and retirement.

AISVS is modeled after the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/projects/asvs) and follows the same philosophy: every requirement should be **verifiable, testable, and implementable**.

### What AISVS is NOT

* **Not a governance framework.** Governance is well-covered by [NIST AI RMF](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework), [ISO/IEC 42001](https://www.iso.org/standard/42001), and EU AI Act compliance guides.
* **Not a risk management framework.** AISVS provides the technical controls that risk frameworks point to, but does not define risk assessment methodology.
* **Not a tool recommendation list.** AISVS is vendor-neutral and does not endorse specific products or frameworks.

### How AISVS complements other standards

| Standard | Focus | AISVS relationship |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OWASP ASVS | Web application security | AISVS extends ASVS concepts to AI-specific threats |
| [OWASP Top 10 for LLMs](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) | Awareness of top LLM risks | AISVS provides the detailed controls to mitigate those risks |
| [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/) | Awareness of top agentic AI risks | AISVS provides the detailed controls to address agentic-specific threats |
| NIST AI RMF | AI risk governance | AISVS supplies the testable technical controls that AI RMF references |
| ISO/IEC 42001 | AI management systems | AISVS complements with implementation-level security verification |

## Verification Levels

Each AISVS requirement is assigned a verification level (1, 2, or 3) indicating the depth of security assurance:

| Level | Description | When to use |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| **1** | Essential baseline controls that every AI system should implement. | All AI applications, including internal tools and low-risk systems. |
| **2** | Standard controls for systems handling sensitive data or making consequential decisions. | Production systems, customer-facing AI, systems processing personal data. |
| **3** | Advanced controls for high-assurance environments requiring defense against sophisticated attacks. | Critical infrastructure, safety-critical AI, high-value targets, regulated industries. |

Organizations should select a target level based on the risk profile of their AI system. Most production systems should aim for at least Level 2.

## How to use AISVS

* **During design.** Use requirements as a security checklist when architecting AI systems.
* **During development.** Integrate requirements into CI/CD pipelines, code reviews, and testing.
* **During security assessments.** Use as a verification framework for penetration testing and audits.
* **For procurement.** Reference specific requirements when evaluating AI vendors and third-party models.

## Research Wiki

For every requirement in the standard, the [Research Wiki](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.01/research/README.md) provides implementation context beyond the requirement text:

| Column | What it tells you |
| --- | --- |
| **Threat Mitigated** | Specific attack techniques, CVEs, and real-world incidents the control defends against |
| **Verification Approach** | Concrete audit steps, tools, and evidence to collect |
| **Gaps & Notes** | Tool maturity ratings, open research questions, and implementation caveats |

The wiki covers every requirement in the released 1.01 standard, with per-section threat landscape summaries, tooling recommendations, and references to current standards and research literature. The wiki for 1.0 is frozen under [1.0/research](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/research/README.md).

## How to Reference AISVS Requirements

Each requirement has an identifier in the format `C<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>`, where each element is a number, for example `C9.4.3`.

- The `C<chapter>` value corresponds to the chapter from which the requirement comes; for example, all `C9.#.#` requirements are from the 'Orchestration & Agentic Security' chapter.
- The `<section>` value corresponds to the section within that chapter where the requirement appears; for example, all `C9.4.#` requirements are in the 'Agent and Orchestrator Identity' section.
- The `<requirement>` value identifies the specific requirement within the chapter and section; for example, `C9.4.3` which as of version 1.0 of this standard is:

> Verify that agent identity credentials rotate on a defined schedule.

Since identifiers may change between versions of the standard, it is preferable for other documents, reports, or tools to use the following format: `v<version>-C<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>`, where `version` is the AISVS version tag. For example: `v1.0-C9.4.3`.

Note: The `v` preceding the version number should always be lowercase.

Identifiers without the `v<version>` element refer to the latest released minor version of AISVS, as defined in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md#referencing-across-versions). Include the version element in reports, tools, and other references that need to remain stable across releases.

---

## Versioning

AISVS uses a two-part version number, `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>` (for example, `v1.0`, `v1.01`, `v2.0`). Major versions cover chapter and section changes, minor versions cover additions, removals, and material edits to requirements within the existing structure, and patch fixes ship in-branch without a separate version. The full policy is documented in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

Each stable release of AISVS is published as a numbered folder in this repository. Once a version is released, its folder is locked; all future work happens in a new folder. This mirrors the approach used by [OWASP ASVS](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS).

```text
/
├── 1.0/        <- published release (locked)
├── 1.01/       <- latest stable release (locked)
├── 1.02-dev/   <- next minor release (in progress)
├── 2.0-dev/    <- next major release (in progress)
```
